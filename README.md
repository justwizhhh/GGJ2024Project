# (ARCHIVE) Global Game Jam 2024 Project

## Play the final submitted build here! - https://justwiz.itch.io/open-mic-knight

This is the repository used to work on and submit our Global Game Jam 2024 submission, Open Mic Knight. Made in 48 hours.

I contributed to several UI features of the game, such as the main menu and the game-over screen. I also helped import (and sometimes animate) all of the game's graphical assets, to ensure they were compatible with the Unity engine, and that they were synced up with gameplay. 

Credits can also be found on the game's itch page, as well as inside the game as well! Huge credit goes to the rest of the team for their hard work.
